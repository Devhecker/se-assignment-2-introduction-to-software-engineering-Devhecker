# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):It applies scientific and mathematical principles to the design, analysis and implementation of software systems. Programming, on the other hand, is mainly concerned with writing code to solve specific problems.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:Agile is an iterative and incremental approach, where requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams. Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach, where each phase of the project must be completed before moving on to the next phase.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:Delivery: Agile allows for quick delivery of projects with shorter lifecycles, as each iteration delivers a workable product. Waterfall requires the completion of all tasks before any work can be released. Flexibility: Agile encourages teams to respond quickly and adaptively to changes during the development process.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles: the practice of defining software manuscripts with sustaining requirement specification and its activities.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:Modularity in software design is a technique where complex software is divided into smaller, independent modules, such as functions, classes, or components. It facilitates easier management and understanding of complex systems by breaking them down into digestible parts.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:Software project managers are responsible for planning, scheduling and managing the delivery of software and web projects. They're usually qualified in computer science, software engineering or a similar subject and have strong technical knowledge of IT, development and computer systems.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:Software maintenance is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs. Software maintenance is done after the product has launched for several reasons including improving the software overall, correcting issues or bugs, to boost performance, and more.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
